# Waste-Detection-Using-YOLO-V5

A Deep Learning project titled “Automated Waste Detection and Classification System”. Manual waste sorting is still widely used. Manual sorting is not only labor-intensive but often results in contamination, low recycling rates, and inefficiencies. The aim of this project is to automate the waste detection and classification process using deep learning. This project proposed as a solution for recyclers and waste management facilities to improve the efficiency and accuracy of dry waste sorting.  I used the WaRP dataset with 7,636 labeled images and trained a YOLOv8m model using Python, PyTorch, and the Ultralytics framework. After training, model achieved a precision of 57.91%, recall of 52.77%, and mAP@50-95 of 45.09%, which was promising given the complexity of the task. This solution has practical use for recycling centers, smart bins, and waste management systems to reduce manual effort and contamination. In the future, it could be integrated with robotic arms and edge AI devices for real-time, low-cost deployments. This project helped me understand how AI can support sustainability efforts and taught me how to handle multi-class image classification with real-world datasets. It’s a great example of applying machine learning beyond typical applications like face or object recognition.

##### About Dataset
The dataset WaRP (Waste Recycling Plant) includes labeled images of an industrial waste sorting plant. I have selected 28 recyclable waste categories. Objects in the dataset are divided into the following groups: plastic bottles of 17 categories (class name with the bottle- prefix), glass bottles of three types (the glass- prefix), card boards of two categories, detergents of four categories, canisters and cans. The -full postfix means that the bottle is filled with air, i.e. not flat.
